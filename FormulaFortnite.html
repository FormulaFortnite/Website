            <h1>How is Formula Fortnite structured?</h1><br>
            <p>
                Formula Fortnite is organized into three categories: FF1, FF2, and FF3. FF1 is the main series,
                where the strongest drivers race and the overall champion is decided. FF2 is for those who
                already have experience but arenâ€™t quite top-tier. FF3 is ideal for beginners or those wanting to
                improve.
                Each category has its own races, points, and rankings. At the end of the season, drivers are promoted or
                relegated based on performance.
